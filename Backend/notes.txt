successfully implemented the functionality for users to both create and accept rides in the DoryCar application. Here's what was accomplished:

- Modified the ride model to replace passenger/driver with creator/acceptor fields
- Updated ride status enums to better reflect the new workflow ('created' instead of 'pending')
- Changed the rating and feedback system to work with creator/acceptor instead of passenger/driver
- Updated the ride routes to support the new model:
  - Changed '/request' endpoint to '/create' for ride creation
  - Modified the accept endpoint to work for any user (removed driver-only restriction)
  - Added validation to prevent users from accepting their own rides
  - Updated all route handlers to use the new creator/acceptor terminology
